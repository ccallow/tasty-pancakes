The best movie I saw this summer was "To all the Boys I've loved Before 2". 
The second movie in the TATB series.
I enjoyed this movie as it taked about the struggles of a teenage relationship in a believable way. My friends and I worked on this movie as extras and it was so cool to see the final project. In addition, it was one of the last projects that I worked on prior to COVID-19.
